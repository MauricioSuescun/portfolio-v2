              I'm originally from Bogot√°, Colombia. I grew up surrounded by
              technology. My passion for it led me to specialize in computer
              maintenance. After years in tech support, I decided to pivot to
              web development.

              I consider myself a creative, detail-oriented, and
              solutions-focused person. I enjoy learning new things daily and
              staying up-to-date on dev trends. I firmly believe that with
              creativity, hard work, and teamwork, we can achieve great things.

              Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other digital
              product, I bring my commitment to design excellence and
              user-centered thinking to every project I work on. I look forward
              to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion to your next
